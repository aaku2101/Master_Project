*For the case where there is one access point:

1. we created the topology with one access point and one station.
2. after thaat we tried to ping from sta1 sta2
3. we noticed that there was no communication from the access point to the controller
4. since there was no flow established between the controller to the access point, we also don't see any rules in the access point by using the command dump.
5. the access point just worked as a hub...why?

--> The answer is in this simple scenario, the access point has only one interface, ap1-wlan0. By default, stations associated with an access point connect in infrastructure mode so wireless traffic between stations must pass through the access point.

*For the case where there are multiple access points:

1. we created a linear topology of 3 access points which are connected to each other and each access point has one base station.
2. Each base station is connected with the access point with a radio interface.

Scenario 1: Station mobility (manual)

- To change sta1's association from ap1 to ap2:
	sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 disconnect
	sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 connect ssid_ap2

Scenario 2: How mininet controller handles this

- for scenario 1, we will try to ping from sta3 to sta1. Here note that sta1 and sta2 are connected to apt2 and sta3 is connected to apt3.
- When we saw the results in the wireshark and using dpctl dump-flows, there were flows established on apt2 and apt3.
