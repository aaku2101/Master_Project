--------Multiple Access Points-----------------

-> Create topology: 
sudo mn --wifi --topo linear,3

-> To see which ap is connected to sta1: 
sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 link

-> Disconnect sta1 and connect to apt2:
sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 disconnect
sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 connect ssid_ap2

-> ping sta1 from sta3:

-> wireshark

-> See flow rules:
dpctl dump-flows

-> Connect back to apt1:
sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 disconnect
sta1 iw dev sta1-wlan0 connect ssid_ap1

-> now see the rules:
dpctl dump-flows

-> Delete all flows:
dpctl del-flows
